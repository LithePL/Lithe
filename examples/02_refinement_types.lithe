TYPE POSITIVE_INT.
  AUTO $defset.

  ~~ Same definition set as UINT but without 0 ~~
  $defset :: #[UINT/defset \ {0}].


TYPE HALVES.
  AUTO $defset.

  ~~:
    Refinement types are very powerful. In this example, we are
    making a type that resembles INT, but the gap between the values
    are 0.5 instead of 1.

    The two first `NULL` mean that we are preserving the bounds.
    In other words, ranging from -inf to +inf, with a step of 0.5.

~~ The following type was brought to you by ChatGPT! ~~
TYPE TENTHS.
  AUTO $defset.

  ~~:
    This type resembles INT, but the gap between the values is 0.1.
    The two first `NULL` mean that we are preserving the bounds,
    ranging from -inf to +inf, with a step of 0.1.
